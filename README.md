# fractional-step-method

Initially a copy of [Alexander](https://github.com/AlexandrShestak) repo. 
Also added improved locality algorithm. Both versions are refactored.

## To do:

- Better implementation for N - number of dimensions. More refactoring, constexpr.
- Improved locality algorithm is wrong. Data exchanges problems exist.
- Initializations are different. Also memory usage for improved locality version is not perfect.
- Some syntax differences. 
- Other stuff.
